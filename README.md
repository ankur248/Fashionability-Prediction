# Fashionability-Prediction
Predicted the Fashionability score (1-10) of images based on the Fashion 144k Dataset. I used Resnet50 for Feature extraction process connecting to a 10-d fc layer. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset, that is, 3000 train mages and 1000 validation images. After training longer, my accuracy came out to be around 14% compared to 17% in the original paper.
